## The Project

A Nextjs project that introduces an auth system using Next-auth.
The project contains a Lansing page, Login, and a user profile page.
It is easy to use and to configure if you are in a rush, looking for a ready
to use Nextjs/TailwindCss Project.

## Configuration

You need to create a .env file that contains these variables:

- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
- NEXTAUTH_URL
- JWT_SECRET

### How to get credentials

- Just access [Google Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials), or check the official [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction) Docs
